M.Sc. & Ph.D. Positions in NeuroAI with a focus on System & Behavioral Neuroscience

---

<h1>Position Overview: </h1>

The Mohajerani Lab (<a href="https://douglas.research.mcgill.ca/majid-mohajerani/"> Link </a>) at Douglas Research Centre/McGill University is seeking prospective M.Sc. or Ph.D. students to join our lab for the Fall 2025 semester. Our research focuses on analyzing animal behavior and brain dynamics through advanced AI-driven methodologies, particularly deep learning tools. The student’s project will involve studying the neural mechanisms underlying memory formation, social behavior, and societal structures in mice. By integrating brain activity data and behavioral analysis, we aim to uncover how neural circuits influence both individual and group behaviors.

Successful candidates will explore the intersection of brain dynamics and behavior, leveraging tools like computer vision and machine learning to decode how brain states are tied to cognitive and social interactions in mice. Applicants should be passionate about exploring how brain activity shapes memory, learning, and social structures, and will work on projects designed to provide insights into how neural plasticity and network connectivity contribute to these behaviors.

As part of this role, students will complete coursework for McGill’s neuroscience program (www.mcgill.ca/ipn/), a world-renowned research hub offering an intellectually stimulating and inspiring environment for academic and career growth. Collaboration is at the heart of our lab, and successful candidates will work with a diverse team of researchers and institutions to advance the frontier of neurobehavioral research.

<h2>Qualifications:</h2>

Degree in computer science, neuroscience, psychology, or related fields
Strong background in coding (Python, MATLAB, etc.)
Experience with AI, deep learning, and machine learning tools (especially for behavioral analysis)
Solid understanding of neuroscience concepts related to brain activity and memory
Previous research experience in neuroscience, computer vision, or behavior studies
Proven ability to work in a collaborative team environment
Excellent problem-solving skills and motivation to tackle complex scientific challenges
High academic achievement (GPA)
Effective communication skills, both written and verbal
Deadline: <b>Nov 15, 2024</b>

<h2>What we offer:</h2>

A Focus on System & Behavioural Neuroscience: Dive deep into research that aims to unravel the complexities of behaviour and brain dynamics through AI. Our projects span various aspects of the field, offering a rich environment for academic and personal growth. 
Collaborative Environment: Work alongside leading scientists in a supportive, interdisciplinary team where your ideas and contributions are valued.
Resources: Access to cutting-edge technology and resources to facilitate your research, experimentation, and learning.
Real-World Impact: Engage in projects that aim to translate scientific discoveries into practical applications, making a tangible difference in the field and beyond.
Academic Excellence: As part of McGill University, you'll be immersed in an environment known for its high standards of research and education.
