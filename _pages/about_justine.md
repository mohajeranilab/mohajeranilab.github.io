Justine completed her BA (Neuroscience specialist) at the University of Toronto and is currently a  Ph.D student in Dr. Mohajeraniâ€™s Lab. Currently, she is investigating the circuitry involved in tactile stimulation-induced rescue of cognitive decline in a mouse model of Alzheimer's Disease. Her research aims to uncover how tactile therapies can modulate neural circuits to alleviate cognitive deficits, providing insights that may lead to effective treatments for Alzheimer's Disease. More broadly, she is dedicated to elucidating the neural mechanisms underlying memory dysfunctions and several neurodegenerative diseases.

Outside the lab, she enjoys hiking, reading books, watching movies and animations.
