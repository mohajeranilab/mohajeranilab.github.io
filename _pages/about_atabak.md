Atabak holds a bachelor’s degree in Theoretical Physics. He joined the Lab in 2023 as a master’s student in Neuroscience at the University of Lethbridge. His research focused on studying amyloid-beta deposition in transgenic Alzheimer’s disease mouse models, which represents one of the early neurobiological hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease. In this work, he quantified amyloid-beta plaques both spatially and temporally across the brain. He completed his Master’s degree in Neuroscience in December 2025 and is currently working as a post-graduate researcher in the Mohajerani Lab.
