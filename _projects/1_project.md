This project is a pipeline for creating synthetic data from a 3D artist-created model of a cow to be used for training pose estimation models. This project managed to offer a solution to reduce the need for acquiring real-world data, and increase the efficiency of the models. Right now, the focus of this project is on designing and creating models for detection, tracking, keypoint estimation {% cite ghassemi2024moo %}, and segmentation of cattles for production level behavioral analysis.
