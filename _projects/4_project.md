The project investigates how tactile sensory stimulation can reduce Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology using a combination of behavioural testing, multi-fibre photometry, optogenetics, and immunohistochemistry. By studying multiple AD mouse models, we aim to identify how touch-evoked neuromodulation influences memory, network excitability, microglial activity, and neurodegeneration, with the broader goal of developing novel, non-invasive, sensory-based interventions for Alzheimer’s disease.
