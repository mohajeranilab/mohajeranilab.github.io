The project develops a scalable self-supervised pipeline to learn 3D behavioural representations from continuous home-cage video, using a combination of 4D motion modelling, unsupervised pose estimation, and sequence prediction. By training across multiple rodent models, we aim to uncover the intrinsic structure of natural behaviour without manual annotations, with the broader goal of building a generalizable foundation model for automated behavioural neuroscience and long-term monitoring.
