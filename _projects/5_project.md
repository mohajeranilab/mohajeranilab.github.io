This project aims to use machine learning tools to identify behavioral deficits in mice infected with Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE), a mouse model of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), performing the String Pulling Task. This will help identify key parameters for categorizing the early onset of EAE symptomology and will guide future studies by providing a more fine tuned approach to EAE symptom tracking.
