This project investigates the effects of 5-HT2A receptor agonists, including psilocybin and DOI, on Alzheimer's disease progression. It focuses on understanding how these compounds modulate behavior, neuroplasticity, neuronal dedifferentiation, inflammation, and the gut-brain axis, using advanced mouse models and multi-level behavioral, imaging, and molecular analyses. The goal is to identify potential therapeutic strategies that slow cognitive decline and restore neuronal function in AD.
