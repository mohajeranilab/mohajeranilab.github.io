One of the earliest hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease is the deposition of amyloid-beta peptides in the extracellular space of the brain, forming structures known as amyloid-beta plaques. In this project, two well-established Alzheimer’s disease mouse models, 5xFAD and APPNL-G-F, were investigated. Ex vivo two-photon tomography was used to acquire high-resolution images of coronal brain sections, enabling accurate detection and quantification of amyloid-beta plaques. Plaque density was quantified across the whole brain in multiple age groups. In addition, region-specific analyses were performed to identify brain regions that were most severely affected by amyloid-beta deposition.
